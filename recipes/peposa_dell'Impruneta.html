    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>The story goes that terracotta tile workers in Impruneta, Tuscany, would place <br>
    this stew into clay pots and cook it in their still-hot kilns overnight where it <br>
    would be ready in the morning. They used a lot of pepper because the meat was <br>
    not always top quality. The amount of pepper is up to you--I used a ridiculous <br>
    amount, but even so it wasn't overpowering.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>6 beef short ribs (8 to 10 oz. each)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>8 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons whole black peppercorns, freshly crushed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>3 sage leaves</li>
        <li>3 small sprigs fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>2 cups red wine, preferably Chianti</li>
        <li>salt to taste, to adjust sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place meat in a large mixing bowl. Sprinkle all sides generously with 1 <br>
            tablespoon kosher salt.</li>
        <li>Place chopped garlic and a pinch of salt in a mortar and mash with pestle until <br>
            pastelike. Add tomato paste; mash until blended. Transfer mixture into bowl <br>
            with beef and rub onto all sides of meat. Add crushed peppercorns and ground <br>
            pepper. Distribute evenly over all sides of beef. Transfer to a deep skillet or <br>
            Dutch oven bone side down. Tuck sage leaves, rosemary, and dry bay leaves <br>
            between pieces of meat. Carefully add wine along the side of the pan to avoid <br>
            washing over the top of the meat.</li>
        <li>Place pan over high heat and bring to a simmer; reduce heat to low. Cover <br>
            tightly. Cook until meat is fork tender, turning pieces every 30 minutes or so, <br>
            about 3 1/2 hours. Transfer pieces of meat to a warm bowl.</li>
        <li>Increase heat to high and bring braising liquid to a boil. Simmer until liquid is <br>
            reduced by about half or until slightly thickened, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove bones <br>
            from meat.</li>
        <li>When sauce is thickened, transfer meat back to skillet. Reduce heat to medium-low <br>
            and spoon sauce over meat. Cook until until heated through, about 5 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
